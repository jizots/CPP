# C++ Modules Series README  
## Overview  
This C++ series covers a comprehensive curriculum designed to introduce and master C++ programming, from basic to advanced topics.  
Each module focuses on different aspects of C++, including object-oriented programming, memory management,  
the Standard Template Library (STL), and more, aimed at transitioning programmers from basic to proficient levels.  
  
## Modules Summary  
### Module 0: 
Introduces C++ basics, focusing on transitioning from C to C++, including namespaces, classes, member functions, and standard I/O.  
Exercises include creating a megaphone program and a simple phonebook, emphasizing clean code and object-oriented principles.  
### Module 1: 
Delves into memory allocation, references, and pointers, using exercises like Zombie classes to practice dynamic memory management and deep copy concepts, enhancing understanding of C++'s memory handling.  
### Module 2:  
Focuses on operator overloading and the Canonical Class Form, teaching how to extend class functionalities through operators, and emphasizing the importance of a well-defined class structure for robust software design.
### Module 3:  
Explores inheritance and class hierarchies, demonstrating how to create scalable and maintainable code by sharing functionalities among classes, with exercises including different robot classes that share behaviors.
### Module 4:  
Covers polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces, using animal hierarchies and materia simulations to teach flexible and reusable code design through polymorphism and interfaces.
### Module 5:  
Introduces exception handling and bureaucratic system simulation, emphasizing robust and error-resistant software design through exercises that implement custom exceptions for error management.
### Module 6:  
Advances into type conversions and casting, highlighting how to manipulate data types and memory safely in C++, crucial for advanced programming and memory management.
### Module 7:  
Teaches C++ templates for generic programming, enabling code that works with any data type.  
Exercises include creating a templated Array class, showcasing efficient, type-safe programming.
### Module 8:  
Dives into STL containers, iterators, and algorithms, focusing on efficient data manipulation and introducing practical exercises like the Span class to apply STL in solving complex problems.
### Module 9:  
Applies STL in advanced applications, tackling real-world programming challenges, and demonstrating mastery in using C++ containers and algorithms for efficient problem-solving.
